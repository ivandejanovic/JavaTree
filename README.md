JavaTree
========

Java Tree is an application for data organizing. It uses a tree node structure to keep the data and can save them to an xml format. Application is developed in Java using Swing.

Application was developed within several hours as an attempt to get data organizing program that does not need administrative privileges so I can use it at work.

The whole application is packaged in one jar file plus one dtd file used to validate saved xmls. To ensure proper validation please keep dtd file in the same directory in which you keep your saved xmls. You can download the whole application from www.quineinteractive.com/javatree. It requires Java 6 at least installed.
